# Sudoku-Solver
This program will solve easy and mid-level sudokus. 

Things to work on:

- The solver works, but I'm sure it can be more efficient.
- Telling the solver when the puzzle is complete so it can stop
- Making it smart enough to solve harder Sudoku puzzles (which, as of this writing, I still can't solve myself)
- A nicer way to enter new puzzles
